# Security Policy

🔐🔐🔐

> Any security issues should be submitted directly to [our security team](mailto:security@safethishome.com).
> In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
>
> - Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
> - Can I disable something for other people?
>
> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email me at dmreh@outlook.com.
